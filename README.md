# Getting started

### Project Configuration
The first step is to fork the project onto your machine. After fork, enter the project and in its root folder create an `.env` file. In this file, you put all your sensitive and environment info.

The `.env` variables are in this link, second part: https://www.notion.so/betprotocol/Layout-1-User-Interface-e4137a6341414ce4af05995c5f1ea3c2

Note: In the link above is also the step by step of what is needed to create an online machine of the entire project in Heroku.

### Project Installation

After creating the `.env` file, we now open a terminal in the project's root folder and install all project dependencies with the command:

    npm install

After that we have to `build` the project, so that we can `start` it and we do it with:

    npm build

Finally, we started the project with:

    npm start
