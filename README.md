# BetProtocol Casino

An example frontend-only game backed by the BetProtocol API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and extended with CRACO.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs tests using `jest` and `react-testing-library`.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
